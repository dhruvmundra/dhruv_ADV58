        <p>My hobby is to paly football as a goalkeeper I started liking football when i was 7 years old and since that I am the crazy fan of football. In every football match there are 11 players each in 2 teams and the team who puts the ball inside the net most wins. There are certain rules in football and the refree takes care of the rules.There are 2 types of card in football a yellow card and a red card, a yellow card is a warning for the player and the red card means that the player who gets the red card cannot play the rest of the game. </p>
